\section{High-Level}\label{high-level}

The high-level design serves as a transition between the requirements
and the full low-level design. Below are designs used to identify key
components of the system and how they shall interact, both with each
other and with the user.

\subsection{Context Model}\label{context-model}

As with many computer games, this system is mostly `self-enclosed' -
that is, it does not require a large amount of interaction with
separately-developed external systems. Thus, the context of the Ant Game
system is minimal. However, unlike many other computer games, the style
of the game can require the user to provide some external `data' before
playing (an ant brain, and sometimes an ant-world). This means that
there is a possibility for external programs to be developed to aid the
user in writing a custom ant brain/world. This would mean that there
would be an interaction between the Ant Game program and two other
systems, as below:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{high-level-diagrams/context-model.png}
\end{center}

However, as per the functional requirements document (\texttt{Game/4}
and \texttt{World/1}) the program shall parse ant brains and worlds from
a \emph{file} (i.e.~only indirectly received from outside software), so
this interaction with external programs does not need to be accounted
for in development.

\subsection{Process Model}\label{process-model}

\subsubsection{User Process}\label{user-process}

The process model on the following page describes a player interacting with the ant game
system. Note that the only two actions where the user is not directly
interacting with the program is the \texttt{Build\ Ant\ Brain} action
and \texttt{Build\ World} action - both of these actions are done
independently of this system by the user (in a text editor or
otherwise). This process model is abstract enough that it applies to
both the two-player game and the tournament. It is assumed that at least
two users are following this process model at the same time, and
interacting with the same instance of the program.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{high-level-diagrams/process-model.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Game Process}\label{game-process}

The following diagram gives a high-level view of the flow of the system
when simulating a game between two ant colonies on a particular world.
Ant brains and a single world are loaded by two actors (the players).
The system then initialises ants on the two anthills for each colony.
Each ants identifiers are also initialised, as per the order in the
functional requirements. The game is then started, lasting for 300,000
rounds. Once the round counter is at its maximum, the food at each
anthill is counted; the team with the most food at their brains anthill
is declared the winner.

\end{center}

\subsection{Use Cases}\label{use-cases}

The process model makes it clearer as to how the user will interact with
the system. From the process model and the requirements, the primary use
cases of the system have been extracted, as below. The only (human)
actors in the following use cases are the players of the game.

\subsubsection{Upload Ant Brain}\label{upload-ant-brain}

navigating to the path of the file, and clicking `Parse' (on the game
setup screen of the system's interface).\tabularnewline

functional requirements for parsing given in
\texttt{Parsing\ Specifications/Brain}. If invalid, the system should
inform the user of what went wrong and on which line (if
relevant).\tabularnewline

Description & This use case can be considered a `superset' of the use
Two Player Game use case. Once each of the players have uploaded the ant
brains and ant worlds, they can start a tournament to compete amongst
multiple ant brains on multiple ant worlds, to see which player is the
overall winner.\tabularnewline

\subsection{System Components}\label{system-components}

From the functional requirements, the process model and use cases, the
main system components and their interactions have been modelled below. Note also the multiplicity between the components.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{high-level-diagrams/system-components.png}
\end{center}

The system components diagram is extremely useful in terms of developing
a full design, and is the fundamental building block of the low-level
design section.

\newpage
\section{Low-Level}

The low-level section of the design goes into further detail of how the system is to be implemented. The lower level design has been done is a slightly non-conventional order --- instead of beginning from the system component diagram to develop detailed class diagrams, the initial point of the low-level design has started from the use cases to construct detailed sequence diagrams. From the sequence diagrams, class diagrams have been constructed to validate the design.

\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

The following sequence diagrams detail, in particular, the behaviour of an ant as it interacts with the world in a game simulation. A single `operation' is described in each sequence, and clearly exposes the relevant components and behaviours associated with the operation. 

\subsubsection{Ant - Drop}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{drop} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-drop.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Flip}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{flip} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-flip.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Mark}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{mark} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-mark.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Move}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{move} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-move.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Pick-Up}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{pick-up} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-pickup.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Sense}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{sense} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-sense.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Turn}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing a \textit{turn} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-turn.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Ant - Unmark}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of an ant when performing an \textit{unmark} instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-unmark.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{World - Execute Instruction}

This sequence diagram describes the actions of the world when interacting with the ant to execute an instruction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/sequence/ant-unmark.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Class Diagrams}

The class diagrams in this section have omitted getters and setters for brevity.

\subsubsection{Instructions}

The following diagram abstracts the different type of \textit{instructions} that an ant brain can carry out. This component of the system follows a linked-list style paradigm - an \texttt{Instruction} has two self-referential attributes \texttt{success} and \texttt{failure}, which are the states that the ant brain will transition to depending on whether the ant's action was a success or a failure. Observe that the majority of classes below have little to no operations, only attributes --- this is because the majority of state changes will be handled by other components, whereas this component is primarily for holding data. All classes are immutable, apart from setting the transition instructions.
 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/class/instruction.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Brain}

Generating the above instruction data is done by the \textit{Brain Parser} component. As can be seen in the brain class diagram, a colony is composed of a colour and a brain - \textbf{note}: a colony of ants shares the same brain - an ant will, upon instantiation, get the start-instruction from the brain, and then keep track of its own state from then on. The brain parser exposes only one public method (to parse an ant brain file). The rest of the methods are to convert a string representation of the given type into the programmatic representation as per the instruction class diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low-level-diagrams/class/brain.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{World}

The next component of the system is the world-related content. The world parser reads a world specification from a file and produces a world instance. A world-generator instance can create a world instance via adding random contest-valid cells. A world is made up of an array of cells, which can have markers added and removed from them --- notice that a marker instance has an associated colony. In addition a cell can also hold an ant, which the world initialises via spawning the ants at the start of a game.
