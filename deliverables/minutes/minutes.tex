\section{Introduction}

During this project, minutes were taken at every group meeting. The group would often meet immediately after a seminar, and also would meet
on Thursday when necessary. Activity sheets were also filled out by each member of the team, describing the work each member did during that week.

\section{Minutes}

\subsection{Meeting 1}

\textbf{Meeting Type}: Initial meeting.

\textbf{Meeting Date}: 18/02/16

\textbf{Meeting Start Time}: 15:09

\textbf{Meeting End Time}: 15:52

\textbf{Attendance}: Regan, Sam, Dan, Arsalan, Kea.

\textbf{Absence}: Jeremiah.

\textbf{Progress}: First meeting, everyone had quickly read the project brief.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- read project description, write notes, split it into major tasks. PERT-chart done by 28/02/2016. Read about Git and GitHub.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: 23/02/2016 14:00

\textbf{Additional Comments}: Decided to test, comment and document the project as we go. Talked about timetable, 3 weeks to get all requirements done, 6 weeks for coding and testing. Possible risks: trains being late, people not showing up, incompatible environments or OS – this can be solved by using Java, losing files or corrupt data – solved with GitHub, requirement changes. Decided our management is democratic decentralised. Going to use Slack and Github.

\textbf{Progress}: Checking progress on each PERT chart developed by each team member.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- Continue PERT chart development, read briefing. Jeremiah --- phase plan. Sal --- organisation plan. Dan --- conflict resolution plan, peer assessment plan. Kea, Regan --- functional requirements. Sam --- non-functional requirements, domain requirements.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: 01/03/2016 14:00

\textbf{Additional Comments}: -

\textbf{Absence}: -

\textbf{Progress}: Ensured all team members are on-track with their tasks as assigned on 23/02. Group discussion resolving clarifications/queries with tasks. Discussed potential high-level models of the system.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- continue working on assigned tasks.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: 08/03/2016 14:00

\textbf{Additional Comments}: -

\subsection{Meeting 4}

\textbf{Meeting End Time}: 14:10

\textbf{Attendance}: Regan, Sam, Dan, Arsalan, Kea, Jeremiah.

\textbf{Absence}: -

\textbf{Progress}: All successfully completed assigned tasks (as per 23/02 meeting). On-track.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- experiment with potential high-level models for the system to share with the group at the next meeting on Thursday.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: 10/03/2016 15:00

\textbf{Additional Comments}: -

\subsection{Meeting 5}

\textbf{Meeting Type}: Review meeting to merge work on high-level project model.

\textbf{Meeting Date}: 10/03/16

\textbf{Meeting Start Time}: 15:00

\textbf{Meeting End Time}: 15:50

\textbf{Attendance}: Regan, Sam, Dan, Arsalan, Kea, Jeremiah.

\textbf{Absence}: -

\textbf{Progress}: Had each created a basic high-level model for the system.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- create lower-level model (add potential attributes, operations, add aggregation, abstraction etc.) from our starting point high-level model to merge at/after the seminar next week.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: 15/03/2016 13:00

\textbf{Additional Comments}: Need to clarify at some point - what kind of game statistics do we take? Order for turns --- decided to flip which team goes first each turn [EDIT - clarified later, ants move according to their identifiers which are allocated at the start of the match].

\subsection{Meeting 6}

\textbf{Meeting Type}: Design plan and PERT chart development meeting.

\textbf{Meeting Date}: 15/03/16

\textbf{Meeting Start Time}: 14:05

\textbf{Meeting End Time}: 14:30

\textbf{Attendance}: Regan, Sam, Dan, Arsalan, Jeremiah.

\textbf{Absence}: Kea (unwell).

\textbf{Progress}: All discussed actions and attributes of the model classes created so far. Assigned Regan as developer of 'core program'. Created plan for Git usage - probably use one 'master' branch for everything and a separate one for when the GUI is developed.

\textbf{Actions}: All --- Design models - lower level - look up and implement one each, based on current high-level design on GitHub.

\textbf{Next Meeting}: TBC.

\textbf{Additional Comments}: -

Dan --- user documentation: create instructional guide for users - how to write an ant-brain, ant-world, how to use the program, peer assessment plan: create plan for how points will be allocated amongst group members. Regan --- programming: implement ant core (game, tournament, brain, etc.). Sal and Jeremiah --- quality assurance: begin implementing tests for test-driven development where possible, write tests as developers implement classes. Jeremiah --- create an ant brain. Sam --- minor changes: revise high-level design - add associations, remove Grid class, update PERT chart - add ant brain design, additions to test specification - Gradle, JaCoCo, documentation, continuous integration, breakpoints, programming: implement parsers and world/cell/sense-related content.
