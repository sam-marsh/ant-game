# Design

## Low-Level - Detailed Design

The detailed design diagrams and documents show the inner-workings of the project. They show exactly how each component interacts
with one another. This provides those who are coding a far simpler job, as the ideas are already in place via these plans, 
so it is their jobs to only implement these ideas, and to put them into practice.
