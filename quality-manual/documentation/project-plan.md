### Staff Organisation

#### Roles

The team consists of Sam, Kea, Jeremiah, Regan and Arsalan. The Project Manager and Technical Leader will be Sam and he will be responsible for critical technical decisions, however the team structure is democractic therefore decisions are formulated as a team. Kea, Dan and Jeremiah will take part in Analysis formulating ideas with the Design team composed of Arsalan and Dan who will communicate with the programming team composed of Regan and Sam to discuss feasible design aspects. Finally Jeremiah and Arsalan will be part of quality assurance working with Regan and Sam to discuss solutions to problems. The PERT Chart and the management of documentation will be managed by Kea, Jeremiah and Sam who will work the rest of the team to ensure the project is on track.

#### Communication, Configuration and Change Mangement

The main communication channel will be Slack where discussions will take place, whereas for information sharing of technical documents Github will be used as it includes version control procedures making it easier to make changes. The team will each store a Project Log keeping track of documents they upload and edit, each document will consist of it's name, author, auditor, version number and last modification date and when a document is uploaded and edited it is communicated across in Slack and reviewed at the next meeting before being approved as further changes may be required. If changes are required this is communicated in Slack or in a team meeting and is later implemented.  

### Analysis Team Responsibilities

The overall responsibilities of Analysis will be to read the project brief in detail and work on the requirements engineering document which will denote of the required functionality of the system and it's constraints. The next step is to communicate this across to the design team who will read the specification and use it as an aid to the design process. The final step is to make any required changes/clarifications to the design team if a requirement is not fully understood.

### Design Team Responsibilities

The overall responsibilities of Design will be to meet the software specification outlined by the analysis team. The team will establish an overall architecture for the system by implementing a high level and detailed design by providing appropriate design documentation in UML visually representing the abstractions identifed by the analysis team and will formulate these into relationships which are later used by the programming team as aids to the implementation of the project. The next step is to refactor the design for the case of the programming team identifying design flaws.

### Programming Team Responsibilities

The overall responsibilities of Programming will be to implement the design effectively using the supplied documentation, whilst also communicating with the design team any potential flaws in the design. The programming team will also work with quality assurance by helping to supply an effective test plan. The programming team will also have an ongoing of step of refactoring any code for the case of design changes communicated by the design team.

### Quality Assurance Team Responsibilities

Quality Assurance will ensure the programming team's implemented solution is thoroughly tested against the requirements identified by the analysis team and communicate any errors which fail to meet these requirements up to the programming team who will make the required changes if necessary. QA will first implement a test plan whilst working with the programming team and design team and then will physically conduct various forms of testing.
