## User Requirements

- Both players design an ant-brain (a simple finite-state machine).
- To run the game, the brains are uploaded into an ant world with two ant colonies, one for each player. 
- The ant world simulates the behaviour of both kinds of ants, using the ant-brains supplied by the players.
- The two species of ants are placed in a random world containing two anthills, some food sources, and several obstacles. 
- Ants must explore the world, find food and bring it back to their anthill. 
- Ants can communicate or leave trails by means of chemical markers.
- Each species of ants can sense (with limited capabilities), but not modify, the markers of the other species.
- Ants can also attack the ants of the other species by surrounding them
- Ants that die as a result of an attack become food.
- The match is won by the species with the most food in its anthill at the end of 300000 rounds.
