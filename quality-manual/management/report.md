# Report
## Team Performance In this short report, I shall be analysing the teamâ€™s performance in the Ant Game project. I shall discuss our overall approach, and document any issues and resolutions to those issues.
Once the team allocations were released at the start of week 3, communication between members was quickly established via social media, specifically Facebook. The members became aware of each other and knew how to quickly contact one another both individually and as a group. An initial meeting was also organised to meet each other face-to-face ahead of the start of the seminars in week 4.
 At this meeting, the tone of all future meetings was set, as we quickly organised ourselves, agreeing that we were a democratic decentralized system, having equal footing and control in everything. We also began to discuss how the various deliverables were to be shared amongst each other. Communication and configuration management systems were officially setup using Slack and GitHub, and all team members were registered and had their local development environments setup by the end of the week. 
This acted as a precursor to our approach as a whole to the project, we would set a task, or series of tasks, to do that week. We would then go off on our own and do said task, then meet together in a pre-arranged meeting to group our thoughts and findings. We find this methodology was the correct idea, as it allowed individualism - it allowed each member to undertake each task as they saw fit, such as a PERT chart or UML. This made sure we had 6 'versions' for each task, most of which were very similar, meaning once we met and combined results, we all had parts that others did not, thus making sure that all bases were covered. We would then discuss our attempts, particularly the areas where we all differed, and then combine and manipulate them all into an in-depth result of all our attempts. The result would be a solution that the entire team had contributed to. We all had our say, and the quality of that particular deliverable showed.
This approach ensured we had a fully-functional game. The parsers took the required inputs, and gave errors and exceptions when an input did not follow the criteria. The ants (and their brains) behaved as expected and as required by the client. The game also follows the criteria laid out. This success is down to the careful planning and team organisation as described above.
Due to this structure, we had had no issues or problems to document. The team has worked very well together, we all got on well, worked hard and did exactly what we were meant to do. We all knew that in order to complete this project we would all need to work in a consistent manner, and that resulted in a project with very few issues. There were of course minor problems caused by events outside our control such as train delays and illness, which were easily dealt with by looking at the recorded minutes to see what was missed.
As a whole, this project can be considered a success. Due to both the team work ethic and general cohesiveness, all the required documentation was completed, as well as the code behaving as it should.
