# Activity Sheet

## Group 07 - Break 01

##### Arsalan Sadeghpour

I have created a folder structure detailing the high level designs, and low level designs. I worked on the high level design by creating a Use Case Diagram representing an Ant's behaviour and 2 Activity Diagrams representing the game execution behaviour and the gameplay and scoring functionality.

##### Dan Read

Began to delve deeper into the design, by looking at the various methods that different objects in the code will need, building towards a class-diagram.
